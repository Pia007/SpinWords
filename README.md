## Overview

### The Challenge

[![wakatime](https://wakatime.com/badge/github/Pia007/SpinWords.svg)](https://wakatime.com/badge/github/Pia007/SpinWords)

Two Sum Function

For this [Code Wars](https://www.codewars.com/kata/5264d2b162488dc400000001/train/javascript) challenge, write a function that takes in a string of one or more words, and returns the same string. But, words with five or more letter will be reversed. in the dashboard, the user inputs a word/words, with each separated by a "space", and clicks the button to evaluate it. Additionally, if the input does not fit the criteria for evaluation, the user is prompted to try again. 

#### NOTE: 
The form automatically resets 5 seconds after the string is evaluated.

#### FILES: 
There are two JavaScript files. Main.js contains the function and additional coding neccessary to connect to the html. Spin.js has the plain function.

### What I learned

I learned to work through the challenge by using a "unpack & re-pack" in approach.  Meaning that, I started with the whole string and unpacked it until the characters of the substring were accessible; then re-packed (or stepped backward) until a string was returned.
