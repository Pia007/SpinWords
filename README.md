## Overview

### The Challenge

Two Sum Function

For this [Code Wars](https://www.codewars.com/kata/5264d2b162488dc400000001/train/javascript) challenge, write a function that takes in a string of one or more words, and returns the same string. But, words with five or more letter will be reversed. in the dashboard, the user inputs a word/words, with each separated by a "space", and clicks the button to evaluate it. Additionally, if the input does not fit the criteria for evaluation, the user is prompted to try again. 

#### NOTE: 
The form automatically resets 3 seconds after the numbers are evaluated.

#### FILES: 
There are two JavaScript files. Main.js contains the function and additional coding neccessary to connect to the html. Spin.js has the plain function.

### What I learned

<!-- Understanding the "two sum" function was a challenge, initially. I had to figure out how to use objects and arrays together. Implementing a dashboard that would give the user feedback was challenging.  -->
